C++ Competitive Programming tips to **improve your thinking speed**, making your life much easier.
- You'll be able to **quickstart** your coding problems.
- Improving your **productivity** while solving coding problems by using our **templates.**
- Providing a better knowledge access with **Cheat Sheets** and quick reference material and links.

## Coding Problems Template :scroll:
### Motivation

If you have to do lots of exercise and rewrite every single template, you don't need to do this anymore. With our templates, you can fill a folder with usefull files, perfect for your job.

### Filling folder with `.cpp`, `.txt` and `Makefile` :mag_right:
Open the `terminal` and type:
```
bash <(curl -sL bash.propi.dev/cp)
```

### Running and Debugging :man_technologist:
After runned `bash script`, you can use **Makefile** to run and debug your coding problems.

Example of usage if you want to **run** or **debug** coding problem D:
```
make run-d
make debug-d
```
