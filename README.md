If you have to do lots of exercise and rewrite every single template, you don't need to do this anymore. With our templates, you can fill a folder with usefull files, perfect for your job.

### Filling folder with `.cpp`, `.txt` and `Makefile` :mag_right:
Open the `terminal` and type:

**Current** version (**Main** branch)
```
bash <(curl -sL bash.propi.dev/cp)
```
**Upcoming** version (**Develop** branch)
```
bash <(curl -sL bash.propi.dev/upcoming/cp) up
```

### Running and Debugging :man_technologist:
After runned `bash script`, you can use **Makefile** to run and debug your coding problems.

Example of usage if you want to **run**, **debug**, **gdb** coding problem D:
```
make run-d        // Run with minimum compile flags 
make debug-d      // Run with a lot of compile flags
make gdb-d        // Run with gdb
make valgrind-d   // Run with valgrind
```

### Template usage
Using **standard** or **complex** templates, you can write less for the same solution
