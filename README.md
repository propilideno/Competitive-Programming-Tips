If you have to do lots of exercise and rewrite every single template, you don't need to do this anymore. With our templates, you can fill a folder with exactly files, perfect for your job.

### Filling folder with our smart templates
Open the `terminal` and type:
```
bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/propilideno/Competitive-Programming-Tips/main/buildLab.sh)
```
